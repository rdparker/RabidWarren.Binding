      <!-- Per http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/4013 the title tag is broken in the 2.8 series. The fix has
      been pulled into the mainline and will show up in 3.0.0.  
      
      Actually it appears that most of the tags are broken and I had to build the nuget CommandLine project from
      source to get the fixes that are pending in 3.0.0.  It was at commit 86a4b0fb, when I did this. -->
