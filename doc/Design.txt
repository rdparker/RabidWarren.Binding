RabidWarren.Binding Design Notes
================================

The RabidWarren.Binding library is meant to provide support for binding
properties between components in a Portable Class Library (PCL) environment.
The common use case is to bind View Model properties to View properties.

Binding to an ungettable property is not permitted.  While some control systems
have set-only values and while set-only properties can be created, they in
effect are little more than commands or triggers, and therefore are treated as
invalid property binding targets.
