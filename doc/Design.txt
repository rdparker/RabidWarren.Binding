RabidWarren.Binding Design Notes
================================

The RabidWarren.Binding library is meant to provide support for binding
properties between components in a Portable Class Library (PCL) environment.
The common use case is to bind View Model properties to View properties.

Binding to an ungettable property is not permitted.  While some control systems
have set-only values and while set-only properties can be created, in effect
they are little more than commands or triggers, and therefore are treated as
invalid property binding targets.

Originally, support for binding to nested properties was planned.  However,
unless the nested property's direct parent implements INotifyPropertyChanged
in cooperation with the parent, there is no way to trigger bound updates when
the property is changed outside the binding mechanism.

Originally there was a ParameterType property for BindingConverterAttributes.
But, they were removed because they were not usable in the form in which they
existed form and there was no immediate need for them.  They may return in the
future.
